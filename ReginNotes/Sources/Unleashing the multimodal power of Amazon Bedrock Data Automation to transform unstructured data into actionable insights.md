Let’s explore a real-world use case showcasing how Amazon Bedrock Data Automation enhances efficiency in loan processing.

Loan processing is a complex, multi-step process that involves document verification, credit assessments, policy compliance checks, and approval workflows, requiring precision and efficiency at every stage. Loan processing with traditional AWS AI services is shown in the following figure.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/03/10/Idp-diagram-01.gif)

As shown in the preceding figure, loan processing is a multi-step workflow that involves handling diverse document types, managing model outputs, and stitching results across multiple services. Traditionally, documents from portals, email, or scans are stored in [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), requiring custom logic to split multi-document packages. Next, [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) or custom classifiers categorize them into types such as W2s, bank statements, and closing disclosures, while [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract) extracts key details. Additional processing is needed to standardize formats, manage JSON outputs, and align data fields, often requiring manual integration and multiple API calls. In some cases, foundation models (FMs) generate document summaries, adding further complexity. Additionally, human-in-the-loop verification may be required for low-threshold outputs.

With Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, this entire process is now simplified into a single unified API call. It automates document classification, data extraction, validation, and structuring, removing the need for manual stitching, API orchestration, and custom integration efforts, significantly reducing complexity and accelerating loan processing workflows as shown in the following figure.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/03/10/idp-diagram-02.gif)

As shown in the preceding figure, when using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, loan packages from third-party systems, portals, email, or scanned documents are stored in Amazon S3, where Amazon Bedrock Data Automation automates document splitting and processing, removing the need for custom logic. After the loan packages are ingested, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation classifies documents such W2s, bank statements, and closing disclosures in a single step, alleviating the need for separate classifier model calls. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation then extracts key information based on the customer requirement, capturing critical details such as employer information from W2s, transaction history from bank statements, and loan terms from closing disclosures.

Unlike traditional workflows that require manual data normalization, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation automatically standardizes extracted data, helping to ensure consistent date formats, currency values, and field names without additional processing based on the customer provided output schema. Moreover, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation enhances compliance and accuracy by providing summarized outputs, bounding boxes for extracted fields, and confidence scores, delivering structured, validated, and ready-to-use data for downstream applications with minimal effort.

In summary, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation enables financial institutions to seamlessly process loan documents from ingestion to final output through a single unified API call, eliminating the need for multiple independent steps.
